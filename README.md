# Need-A-Read-Me

## Description
*This is an app that takes a users input from terminal and adds it to a readme.md template for them to use.

## Motivation
*My motivation behind this project was to make an app that could take a users input and put it into a readme that is already formatted and has all of the requirements needed for a good readme to both save time and repetition.
